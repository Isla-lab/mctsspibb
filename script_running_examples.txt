- Gridworld experiment of Section 'Results on convergence'.
	Run: python results_on_convergence_gridworld.py

  Information about the experiment: It reproduces the experiment of Section 'Results on convergence' on GridWorld of size 3x3, 4x4, 5x5
  For each size the script computes SPIBB and MCTS-SPIBB policy for all the states of domain, varying the length of dataset (100, 1000, 10000) and for each
  length it tests the algorithms on 20 dataset.
  Estimated length of esperiment on our computer: ~1-2 days 

- SysAdmin experiment of Section 'Results on convergence'.
	Run: python results_on_convergence_sysadmin.py

  Information about the experiment: It reproduces the experiment of Section 'Results on convergence' on SysAdmin with 7 machines
  For each size the script computes SPIBB and MCTS-SPIBB policy for all the states of domain, varying the length of dataset (100, 1000, 10000) and for each
  length it tests the algorithms on 20 dataset.
  Estimated length of esperiment on our computer: ~2-2.5 days

  Information about the experiment: It reproduces the experiment of Section 'Results on scalability' on SysAdmin with 4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 20, 35 machines
  The script calcultates the computational time for SPIBB, SPIBB_DP and MCTS-SPIBB algorithms varying the size of domain.
  It also computes the performance based on expected discounted return varying the size of domain and for each size it computes the performance of algorithms on 20 dataset.
  Estimated length of esperiment on our computer: ~2-3 days
